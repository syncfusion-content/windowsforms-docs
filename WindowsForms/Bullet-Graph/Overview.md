# Windows Forms Bullet Graph Overview

Bullet Graph is a variation of the bar graph that is developed as a replacement for the dashboard gauges and meters. The Bullet Graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue), and compares that measure to one or more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target). It displays the measures in the context of the qualitative range of performance, such as poor, satisfactory, and good.

### Use Cases:

* It is used in the dashboard environment where the screen real-estate really counts.
* Bullet Graph shows a ton of data in a very compact space.
* It is handy to visualize data.
* It is used in the revenue analysis and expense analysis.
