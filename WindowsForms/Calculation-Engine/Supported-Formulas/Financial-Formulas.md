**Where:**

* rate is the interest rate for the loan.

* nper is the total number of payments for the loan.

* pv is the present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.

* fv is the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If Fv is omitted, it is assumed to be zero.

* type is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due.

**Syntax:**



_PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])_



**where:**

* rate is the interest rate per period.

* nper is the total number of payment periods in an annuity.

* pmt is the payment made each period and cannot change over the life of the annuity.

* type is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due.



## DB

Calculates the depreciation of an asset for a specified period, using the fixed-declining balance method.

**Syntax:**

_DB(cost, salvage, life, period, [month])_

**where:**

* cost denotes the initial cost of the asset.

* salvage denotes the value at the end of the depreciation (sometimes called the salvage value of the asset).

* life denotes the number of periods over which the asset is being depreciated (sometimes called the useful life of the asset).

* period denotes the period for which you want to calculate the depreciation. Period must use the same units as life.

* month denotes the number of months in the first year. If month is omitted, it is assumed to be 12.



## DDB

**where:**

* cost denotes the initial cost of the asset.

* salvage denotes the value at the end of the depreciation (sometimes called the salvage value of the asset).

* life denotes the number of periods over which the asset is being depreciated (sometimes called the useful life of the asset).

* period denotes the period for which you want to calculate the depreciation. Period must use the same units as life.

* month denotes the number of months in the first year. If month is omitted, it is assumed to be 12.

## FV

**where:**



* rate denotes the interest rate per period.



* nper denotes the total number of payment periods in an annuity.



* pmt denotes the payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the annuity. Typically, pmt contains principal and interest but no other fees or taxes. If pmt is omitted, you must include the pv argument.



## IRR

Calculates the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows.

**Syntax:**

_IRR(values, [guess])_

**where:**

* `values` denotes an array or a reference to cells that contain numbers for which you want to calculate the internal rate of return.

	* Values must contain at least one positive value and one negative value to calculate the internal rate of return.

	* IRR uses the order of values to interpret the order of cash flows. Be sure to enter your payment and income values in the sequence you want.

	* If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored.

* `guess` denotes a number that you guess is close to the result of IRR.

	* Microsoft Excel uses an iterative technique for calculating IRR. Starting with guess, IRR cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate within 0.00001 percent. If IRR can't find a result that works after 20 tries, the `#NUM!` error value is returned.

	* In most cases you do not need to provide guess for the IRR calculation. If guess is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.1 (10 percent).

	* If IRR gives the `#NUM!	 error value, or if the result is not close to what you expected, try again with a different value for guess.

	* Values must contain at least one positive value and one negative value to calculate the modified internal rate of return. Otherwise, MIRR returns the #DIV/0! error value.

	* If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.

	* Arguments that are empty cells, logical values, or text representations of numbers, error values, or text that cannot be translated into numbers are ignored.

	* If an argument is an array or reference, only numbers in that array or reference are counted. Empty cells, logical values, text, or error values in the array or reference are ignored.
