## T.DIST

The `T.Dist` returns the Percentage Points (probability) for the Student t-distribution where a numeric value (x) is a calculated value of t for which the Percentage Points are to be computed. 

**Syntax:**

**where:**

* X is the numeric value at which to evaluate the distribution.

* Deg_freedom  is an integer indicating the number of degrees of freedom.

* Tails is the number of distribution tails to return. If Tails = 1, TDIST returns the one-tailed distribution. If Tails = 2, TDIST returns the two-tailed distribution.

**Remarks:**

* If any argument is non-numeric, TDIST returns the `#VALUE!` error value.

* If Deg_freedom < 1, TDIST returns the #NUM! error value.

* The Deg_freedom and Tails arguments are truncated to integers.

* If Tails is any value other than 1 or 2, TDIST returns the #NUM! error value.

* If x < 0, then TDIST returns the #NUM! error value.

* If Tails = 1, TDIST is calculated as TDIST = P( X>x ), where X is a random variable that follows the t-distribution. If Tails = 2, TDIST is calculated as TDIST = P(&#124;X&#124; > x) = P(X > x or X < -x).

* Since x < 0 is not allowed, to use TDIST when x < 0, note that TDIST(-x,df,1) = 1 – TDIST(x,df,1) = P(X >-x) and TDIST(-x,df,2) = TDIST(x,df,2) = P(&#124;X&#124; > x).

**where:**

* array is the array or range of values to trim and average.

**Remarks:**

* Percent must be >= 0 and <= 1.

* TRIMMEAN rounds off the number of excluded data points down to the nearest multiple of 2. If percent = 0.1, 10 percent of 30 data points equals 3 points. For symmetry, TRIMMEAN excludes a single value from the top and bottom of the data set.
