The [CheckBoxAdv](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CheckBoxAdv.html) control can replace the CheckBox control provided in Windows Forms. This type of control can be defined as consisting of a graphic and associated text that the user clicks to select or deselect an option. A check mark in the check box graphic indicates the option selected. In the CheckBoxAdv control, the graphic can be changed to an image that indicates a selected or deselected state.
