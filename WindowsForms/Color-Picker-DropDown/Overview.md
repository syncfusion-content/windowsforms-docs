# Windows Forms Color Picker DropDown Overview

The ColorPickerButton allows .NET developers to provide a standard user interface similar to the Visual Studio .NET color picker dropdown, for selecting colors in Windows Forms applications. The ColorPickerButton displays the ColorUIControl as a drop-down in combination with a button. The .NET Framework provides a color dialog control to allow applications to collect color information from users. However, the color dialog control does not provide any way to place a control within the layout of the application to collect color information. The ColorUIControl provides an easy to use color palette control that can be placed inline in your applications.
