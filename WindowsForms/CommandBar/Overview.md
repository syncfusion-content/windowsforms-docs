# Windows Forms CommandBar (CommandBars) Overview

[CommandBar](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBar.html) implements a framework for creating and hosting ToolBars, ReBars, and StatusBars similar to those that are found in the Visual Studio .NET and Office XP user interfaces.
