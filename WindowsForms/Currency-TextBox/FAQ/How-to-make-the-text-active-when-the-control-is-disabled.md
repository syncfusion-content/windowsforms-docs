# How to make the text active when the control is disabled

When the control is set to disabled, we could not make any changes in it. But we can make the text active by setting [DrawActiveWhenDisabled](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TextBoxExt.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_TextBoxExt_DrawActiveWhenDisabled) to True.

The following figure illustrates this.
