# How To Retrieve the Port Information Of a Particular Symbol

You can retrieve port information of a particular symbol using the HandlesHitTesting.GetConnectionPointAtPoint(Node, Point) method.

This method has two parameters: _Node_ and _Port_. 

* Node specifies the symbol in which the port resides 
* Point specifies the Point object that holds the location of the port.
