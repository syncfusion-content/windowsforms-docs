# How to find the nearest ConnectionPoint when mouse hover on the node

By default, when hover over the Diagram nodes, the CentralPort will be highlighted and establish connection to the node. If you disabled the CentralPort, then highlight the ConnectionPoint (which is currently under in the mouse pointer) to establish the connection.

Now, you can customize the DiagramController class and override the GetConnectionPointAtPoint method to get the nearest ConnectionPoint to highlight and establish the connection in application. 

The following code example illustrates to highlight and establishing the connection with the nearest ConnectionPoint while hovering the node.

### Establish the connection with nearest ConnectionPoint

You should customize the DiagramController class in your application. Refer to the following code example for customizing the DiagramController class.

public class CustomController : DiagramController

private int hitPadding = 20;
public CustomController()

{

}

public CustomController(Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.View view)
: base(view)
{

}
public override ConnectionPoint GetConnectionPointAtPoint(PointF ptSnapping)
{
ConnectionPoint port = base.GetConnectionPointAtPoint(ptSnapping);

NodeCollection nodes = this.Model.Nodes;
foreach (Node node in nodes)
{
if (!(node is ConnectorBase))
{
double lowDistance = 0;
int index = 0;
RectangleF nodeBounds = node.GetNodeBounds(false, true);
nodeBounds.Inflate(hitPadding, hitPadding);
if (nodeBounds.Contains(ptSnapping))
{
//to find the nearest port...
for (int i = 1; i < node.Ports.Count; i++)
{                            
ConnectionPoint port1 = node.Ports[i];
PointF portPos = port1.GetPosition();
portPos = node.ConvertToModelCoordinates(portPos);
//To find lowest distance of port from current point...
double dis = Geometry.PointDistance(ptSnapping, portPos);
if (dis < lowDistance || i == 1)
{
lowDistance = dis;
index = i;
}
}
return node.Ports[index];
}
}
}
return port;
