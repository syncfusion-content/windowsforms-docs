# Windows Forms Diagram Overview

This section covers information on Essential® Diagram control, its key features, and prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers and finally the documentation details complimentary with the product. It comprises the following sub sections:

## Introduction To Essential® Diagram

Essential® Diagram is an extensible and high-performance .NET Diagramming Framework for Windows Applications. It can be used for developing Microsoft Visio-like interactive graphics and diagramming applications. It stores graphical objects in a node graph and renders those objects onto the screen. Essential® Diagram supports both vector and raster graphics on the drawing surface.

Essential® Diagram lets users create interactive diagrams easily using the Diagram Builder utility included with the Diagram. It explicitly lays out diagram objects, or allows our built-in layout managers to handle the job, making complex layout diagrams a snap. Using the Symbol Designer utility, you can create domain or business specific symbols by using custom shapes and images.
