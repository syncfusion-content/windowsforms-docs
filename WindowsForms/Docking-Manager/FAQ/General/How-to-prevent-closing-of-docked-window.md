<tr>
<td>

<tr>
<td>

</table>


{% tabs %}

private void dockingManager1_DockVisibilityChanging(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.DockVisibilityChangingEventArgs arg)

{

     arg.Cancel = true;

}

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight VB %}

Private Sub dockingManager1_DockVisibilityChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal arg As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.DockVisibilityChangingEventArgs) Handles dockingManager1.DockVisibilityChanging

     arg.Cancel = True
