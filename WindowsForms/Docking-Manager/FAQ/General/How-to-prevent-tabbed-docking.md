# How to prevent tabbed docking?

DockAllow event will be handled when a docking window is dragged over a potential dock target. In other words, whenever the user tries to dock a docked control to another docked control, this event will be raised. This lets you decide whether to allow tabbing or not. Giving arg.Cancel to `true` cancels the docking operation.
