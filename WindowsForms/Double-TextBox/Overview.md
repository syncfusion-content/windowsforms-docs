# Windows Forms Double TextBox Overview

The DoubleTextBox is a text box-derived control that can display double data type values.

The DoubleTextBox is derived from Windows Forms Framework text box control. The DoubleTextBox supports display and collection of double values. It handles user keyboard input and double formatting and uses the globalization features of the .NET platform to provide locale specific formatting.
