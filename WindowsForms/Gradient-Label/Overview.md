# Windows Forms Gradient Label Overview

The GradientLabel class provides a way to create fancy and appealing labels in your forms.

The GradientLabel class is fully compatible with the Windows Forms label that it derives from and gets most of its uniqueness from the BrushInfo class that is used for the GradientLabel.BackgroundColor property.

The GradientLabel.Border3DStyle is another property that can specify the look and feel of the GradientLabel.
