# Formula Support in Windows Forms Grid Control
Setting cell type of a cell to **FormulaCell** will allow to enter algebraic expressions using formulas and cell references. Formula cells can be used for every cell in a grid or just for a few cells. If the cell value starts with an equal sign, then the cell is considered as a formula cell and its contents are treated as such.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Setting Formula cell for a particular cell
this.gridControl1[2, 2].CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}

'Setting Formula cell for a particular cell
Me.gridControl1(2, 2).CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
## Operators
The current formula support will allow well-formed parenthetical algebraic expressions with operators and operands. The 10 supported operators are shown in the following precedence table.

## Architecture
Formula Cell control is implemented with four classes. [GridFormulaCellModel](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaCellModel.html), [GridFormulaCellRenderer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaCellRenderer.html), [GridFormulaEngine](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html) and [GridFormulaTag](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaTag.html).
`GridFormulaCellModel` class does some significant work in its[GetFormattedText](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaCellModel.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaCellModel_GetFormattedText_Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridStyleInfo_System_Object_System_Int32_) method override where calculations and formula parsing are initiated dynamically.
`GridFormulaCellRenderer` class handles a couple of activation methods that are specific for displaying formulas when a formula cell is activated.
`GridFormulaEngine` class does the actual parsing and calculation that is required to evaluate a formula in a cell. This class also maintains Formula Library.
`GridFormulaTag` class is used in conjunction with[GridStyleInfo](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridStyleInfo.html) class that has a property of this type. `GridFormulaTag` tracks computed value of the cell in its Text property.

You could then make a conservative guess at an interest rate and determine how much you must save each month. If future_value is omitted, you must include the payment argument.
* **type** is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due. If type equals:
  * 0 - Payments are due at the end of the period.

If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for number_of_periods.
* In annuity functions, the cash you pay out such as a deposit to savings is represented by a negative number; the cash you receive such as a dividend check is represented by a positive number.
* One financial argument is solved in terms of the others. If rate is not 0, then, If rate is 0, then, (payment * number_of_periods) + present_value + future_value = 0

## Custom Functions
GridControl also supports adding custom functions in the function library. This section will explain how to add and remove functions in function library.

### Add Function
A custom function can be added into the function library by using the [AddFunction](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_AddFunction_System_String_Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_LibraryFunction_) method but before adding the function it is necessary to create a new formula. The below steps needs to be followed to create and add a custom formula into the function library.

1.Define a method that has the below signature.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
//Defines a method whose name is the Formula Name.
public string MyLibraryFormulaName(string args)
{
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
'Defines a method whose name is the Formula Name.
Public Function MyLibraryFormulaName(ByVal args As String) As String
End Function
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
Here `MyLibraryFormulaName` must be a name that has not already been used in Function Library and must include only letters and digits. Write the required implementation in this method.

The below code is used to implement a function that will sum only positive numbers that are passed in as either a range like `A1:A5` or a list such as `A1`, `A4`, `A10`. The code uses the [FormulaEngine](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html) helper method to extract these values from the cells. 

The [GetCellsFromArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_GetCellsFromArgs_System_String_) method will return an array of cells from a range such as `A1:A5`, and [GetValueFromArg](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_GetValueFromArg_System_String_) method will take cells such as `A3` and return a value.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Implements the desired method.
public string ComputeSumPosNumber(string args)
{
    GridFormulaCellModel model = this.gridControl1.CellModels["FormulaCell"] as GridFormulaCellModel;
    if (model != null)
    {
        GridFormulaEngine engine = model.Engine;
        double sum = 0d;
        double d;
        string s1;

            if (r.IndexOf(':') > -1)
            {

                    try
                    {
                        s1 = engine.GetValueFromArg(s);

                        //Adds only if positive.
                        if (double.TryParse(s1, NumberStyles.Number, null, out d) && d > 0)
                        {
                            sum += d;
                        }
                    }

2.The created formula has to be added to the formula library. It has to be added after the Grid is initialized. The following code explains how to achieve it.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

GridFormulaCellModel cellModel = this.gridControl1.CellModels["FormulaCell"] as GridFormulaCellModel;

//Adds a formula named SumPosNumber to the Library.
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("SumPosNumber", new GridFormulaEngine.LibraryFunction(ComputeSumPosNumber));

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}

Dim cellModel As GridFormulaCellModel = TryCast(Me.gridControl1.CellModels("FormulaCell"), GridFormulaCellModel)

'Adds a formula named SumPosNumber to the Library.
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("SumPosNumber", New GridFormulaEngine.LibraryFunction(ComputeSumPosNumber))

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Remove Function
To remove a single function from the Function Library, use the [RemoveFunction](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_RemoveFunction_System_String_) method. Pass the function name as string in this method to remove it from the library.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
// Remove formula name MyMin from the Library.
engine.RemoveFunction("MyMin");
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
' Remove formula name MyMin from the Library.
engine.RemoveFunction("MyMin")
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Replace Function
To replace an existing function with another implementation, it is necessary to remove the original name, and add the same name again with a different delegate method.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
//Removes the SUM function from the library.
cellModel.Engine.RemoveFunction("SUM");

//Add the function of SUM but with the name MySUM
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("MySUM", cellModel.Engine.ComputeSum);
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
'Removes the SUM function from the library.
cellModel.Engine.RemoveFunction("SUM")

'Add the function of SUM but with the name MySUM
cellModel.Engine.AddFunction("MySUM", cellModel.Engine.ComputeSum)
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Clear All Functions
It is possible to clear all the functions from the hash table that holds them by using the `Engine.LibraryFunctions.Clear` method. Removing unused functions from the function library, reduces the memory usage and speeds up parsing as well. It is also used to add only few selected libraries and can remove all the unwanted libraries. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
// Removes all functions from the Library.
cellModel.Engine.LibraryFunctions.Clear();
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
'Removes all functions from the Library.
cellModel.Engine.LibraryFunctions.Clear()
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

New functions can be added after clearing all the functions from the function library. To know how to add functions, refer the [Add Function](#_Add_Function "") topic.

## Cross Sheet Reference
A formula cell can be defined with values from another grid by using cross sheet references. In this case, multiple grids can either be in worksheet format or multiple grids can be laid out in a form. This section explains on how to apply cross reference support between two grids.

Initially, register both the grids by using the static[RegisterGridAsSheet](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_RegisterGridAsSheet_System_String_Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridModel_System_Int32_) method. This method can be seen in the[GridFormulaEngine](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html) class. Registering both the grids can be referenced in a formula from each other.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//Register the grid1 so it can be referenced in a formula from grid2.
GridFormulaEngine.RegisterGridAsSheet(this. gridControl1.Text, this. gridControl1.Model, 0);

//Register the grid2 so it can be referenced in a formula from grid1.
GridFormulaEngine.RegisterGridAsSheet(this. gridControl2.Text, this. gridControl2.Model, 0);

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}

'Register the grid1 so it can be referenced in a formula from grid2.
GridFormulaEngine.RegisterGridAsSheet(Me. gridControl1.Text, Me. gridControl1.Model, 0)

'Register the grid2 so it can be referenced in a formula from grid1.
GridFormulaEngine.RegisterGridAsSheet(Me. gridControl2.Text, Me. gridControl2.Model, 0)
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
 After registering, the values of `grid1` can be accessed in the formula cell of grid by assigning the string `"=gridControl1!B3 + B4"` to that particular formula cell. Where `grid1` denotes the name of the first grid. `B3 + B4` denotes the formula.
For better understanding lets add two grids in a WinForms application. Register both the grids by using the above mentioned code. Now apply some values in the `grid1`.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

this.gridControl1[3, 1].Text = "Salary1";
this.gridControl1[3, 2].Text = "2,000";
this.gridControl1[4, 1].Text = "Salary2";
this.gridControl1[4, 2].Text = "1,500";
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Me.gridControl1(3, 1).Text = "Salary1"
Me.gridControl1(3, 2).Text = "2,000"
Me.gridControl1(4, 1).Text = "Salary2"
Me.gridControl1(4, 2).Text = "1,500"
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
![Formula-Support_img_1](Formula-Support_images/Formula-Support_img_1.jpg)

Now compute the values for the `grid2` by using the values in the `grid1` by using the below code.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.gridControl2[3, 2].Text = "Salary1";
this.gridControl2[4, 2].Text = "Salary2";
this.gridControl2[5, 2].Text = "Total";

// Assigning the cell type as formula cell
this.gridControl2[3, 3].CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell;

// Assigning the formula.
this.gridControl2[3, 3].Text = "=" + this.gridControl1.Text + "!C3";

// Assigning the cell type as formula cell
this.gridControl2[4, 3].CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell;

// Assigning the formula.
this.gridControl2[4, 3].Text = "=" + this.gridControl1.Text + "!C4";

// Assigning the cell type as formula cell
this.gridControl2[5, 3].CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell;

// Assigning the formula.
this.gridControl2[5, 3].Text = "=" + this.gridControl1.Text + "!C3 + C4";
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}

Me.gridControl2(3, 2).Text = "Salary1"
Me.gridControl2(4, 2).Text = "Salary2"
Me.gridControl2(5, 2).Text = "Total"

'Assigning the cell type as formula cell
Me.gridControl2(3, 3).CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell

'Assigning the formula.
Me.gridControl2(3, 3).Text = "=" & Me.gridControl1.Text & "!C3"

' Assigning the cell type as formula cell
Me.gridControl2(4, 3).CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell

'Assigning the formula.
Me.gridControl2(4, 3).Text = "=" & Me.gridControl1.Text & "!C4"

'Assigning the cell type as formula cell
Me.gridControl2(5, 3).CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell

'Assigning the formula.
Me.gridControl2(5, 3).Text = "=" & Me.gridControl1.Text & "!C3 + C4"

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

![Formula-Support_img1_2](Formula-Support_images/Formula-Support_img1_2.png)


## Named Ranges
GridControl supports named ranges along with Grid Formula Engine. Named ranges let the users to set up names for expressions or ranges, and then use these names in formulas. For example, if the name of the range, `B4:B12` is `Expenses`, then the formula `=Sum(Expenses)` can be used instead of `=Sum(B4:B12)`.

For adding the custom name for a particular range, [AddNamedRange](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaEngine_AddNamedRange_System_String_System_String_) property under the [GridFormulaEngine](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaEngine.html) has to be used. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
GridFormulaEngine engine;
engine = ((GridFormulaCellModel)gridControl1.Model.CellModels["FormulaCell"]).Engine;
engine.AddNamedRange("Total", "A1:A3");
this.gridControl1[3, 3].CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Dim engine As GridFormulaEngine
engine = (CType(gridControl1.Model.CellModels("FormulaCell"), GridFormulaCellModel)).Engine
engine.AddNamedRange("Total", "A1:A3")
Me.gridControl1(3, 3).CellType = GridCellTypeName.FormulaCell
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

After using the above code, the formula `A1:A3` can be accessed in anywhere in a formula cell by just using the text `Total`.

### Named Range Collection Editor
GridControl provides **Named Range Collection Editor**, in which it is possible to edit the named ranges. To display the **Named Range Collection Editor** make use of the method.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
GridFormulaCellModel cellModel = this.gridControl1.CellModels["FormulaCell"] as GridFormulaCellModel;
GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper.ShowNamedRangesDialog(cellModel.Engine);
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Dim cellModel As GridFormulaCellModel = TryCast(Me.gridControl1.CellModels("FormulaCell"), GridFormulaCellModel)
GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper.ShowNamedRangesDialog(cellModel.Engine)
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

![Formula-Support_img76](Formula-Support_images/Formula-Support_img76.jpg)

In the dialog box all the named range members will be displayed in the left pane and their corresponding properties in the right pane. Previously a named range `Total` has been added and hence the named range dialog box shows the value `Total` by default. It is possible to add or remove the existing or custom ranges using this **Named Range Collection Editor**.

![Formula-Support_img77](Formula-Support_images/Formula-Support_img77.jpg)

It is possible to edit the title of this editor by handling [ShowingNamedRangesDialog](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Grid_GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper_ShowingNamedRangesDialog) event.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper.ShowingNamedRangesDialog += new ControlEventHandler(GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper_ShowingNamedRangesDialog);

//Event handler changes the title of Named Range Collection Editor dialog box.
void GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper_ShowingNamedRangesDialog(object sender, ControlEventArgs e)
{
    Form f = e.Control as Form;
    if (f != null)
    {

//Sets title for the dialog box.
        f.Text = "CashFlow Inputs";
    }   
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
AddHandler GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper.ShowingNamedRangesDialog, AddressOf GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper_ShowingNamedRangesDialog

'Event handler changes the title of Named Range Collection Editor dialog box.
Private Sub GridFormulaNamedRangesEditHelper_ShowingNamedRangesDialog(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ControlEventArgs)
    Dim f As Form = TryCast(e.Control, Form)
    If f IsNot Nothing Then

'Sets title for the dialog box.
        f.Text = "CashFlow Inputs"
    End If
End Sub
