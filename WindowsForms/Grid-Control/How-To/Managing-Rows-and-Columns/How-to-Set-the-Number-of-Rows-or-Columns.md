# How to set the number of rows or columns

Dynamically changing the RowCount or ColCount properties while a GridControl is being displayed is an efficient way to add or remove rows and/or columns from a GridControl. Using the designer, set gridâ€™s RowCount and ColCount properties. From code, set these properties after the call to InitializeComponent in the form's constructor (or anytime later in your code after the GridControl has been created). 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
public Form1()
{
    //Requires for Windows Form Designer support.
    InitializeComponent();

    //Sets the number of rows.
    gridControl1.RowCount = 20;

    //Sets the number of columns.
    gridControl1.ColCount = 200;
}

{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vb %}

Public Sub New()
MyBase.New()

'This call is required by the Windows Form Designer.
InitializeComponent()

'Adds any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call.
	
'Sets the number of rows.  
 GridControl1.RowCount = 20 

'Sets the number of columns.
GridControl1.ColCount = 200 

End Sub
{% endhighlight  %}
{% endtabs %}
