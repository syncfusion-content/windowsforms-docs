# How to change a characteristic of an HTML element before it is displayed?

The characteristic of an element can be easily changed in the PreRenderDocument event of the HTMLUI control.

The [PreRenderDocument](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.HTMLUI.HTMLUIControl.html) event is raised when the elements in the HTML document are created in the HTMLUI control, but their size and location are not calculated yet.

The following snippet shows how an image reference is changed for a page in the HTMLUI at run time, by using the PrerenderDocument event.

{% highlight C# %}



Hashtable tab = new Hashtable();



// Event Declaration.

this.htmluiControl1.PreRenderDocument += newSyncfusion.Windows.Forms.HTMLUI.PreRenderDocumentEventHandler(this.htmluiControl1_PreRenderDocument);



// Event that is to be raised when a tree of element has been created and their size and location have 

// not been calculated yet.

private void htmluiControl1_PreRenderDocument(object sender,PreRenderDocumentArgs e)

{

// Create and Return the Hash Table where key is Tag name(Element.Name) and Value is array of

// elements with Current name.

this.tab = e.Document.GetElementsByNameHash();

ArrayList image = this.tab["img"] as ArrayList;

foreach(BaseElement elem in image)

{

string oldValue = elem.Attributes["src"].Value;

string newValue = @"C:\MyProjects\ImageHandling\newImage.jpg";



// Replace or change the value of the attribute in the element at run time.

elem.Attributes["src"].Value = oldValue.Replace(elem.Attributes["src"].Value, newValue);

Console.WriteLine(elem.Attributes["src"].Value);

}

} 

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight VB %}



Private tab As Hashtable = New Hashtable()



' Event Declaration.

Me.htmluiControl1.PreRenderDocument += New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.HTMLUI.PreRenderDocumentEventHandler(Me.htmluiControl1 _PreRenderDocument)



' Event that is to be raised when a tree of element has been created and their size and location have 

' not been calculated yet.

Private Sub htmluiControl1_PreRenderDocument(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As PreRenderDocumentArgs)



' Create and Return the Hash Table where key is Tag name(Element.Name) and Value is array of

' elements with Current name.

Me.tab = e.Document.GetElementsByNameHash()

Dim image As ArrayList = CType(IIf(TypeOf Me.tab("img") Is ArrayList, Me.tab("img"), Nothing), ArrayList)

For Each elem As BaseElement In image

Dim oldValue As String = elem.Attributes("src").Value

Dim newValue As String =@"C:\MyProjects\ImageHandling\newImage.jpg";



' Replace or change the value of the attribute in the element at run time.

elem.Attributes("src").Value = oldValue.Replace(elem.Attributes("src").Value, newValue)

Console.WriteLine(elem.Attributes("src").Value)

Next elem

End Sub

{% endtabs %}

The following figure illustrates this behavior where the oldImage has been replaced by newImage.
