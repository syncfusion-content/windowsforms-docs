# Windows Forms MaskedTextBox (MaskedEditBox) Overview

The MaskedEditBox control is an edit control that provides an easy and reliable way of collecting user input and displaying standard data in specific formats from any data source. Some of the common uses of the MaskedEditBox controls are IP Addressed it control, Phone Number edit control and Social Security edit control.

If you define an input mask using the Mask property, each character position in the MaskedEditBox control maps to either a placeholder of a specified type or a literal character. Literal characters, or literals, can give visual cues about the type of data being used. For example, the parentheses surrounding the area code of a telephone number are literals: (919).

MaskedEditBox control exhibits the similar properties of CurrencyTextBox.
