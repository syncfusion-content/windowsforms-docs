If you define an input mask using the Mask property, each character position in the MaskedEditBox control maps to either a placeholder of a specified type or a literal character. Literal characters, or literals, can give visual cues about the type of data being used. For example, the parentheses surrounding the area code of a telephone number are literals: (919).

MaskedEditBox control exhibits the similar properties of CurrencyTextBox.
