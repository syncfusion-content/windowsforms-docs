# How to give the space between text and Icon in the GroupBarItem?

The [Padding](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.GroupBarItem.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_GroupBarItem_Padding) property of GroupBarItem provides spacing between Icons and text in the GroupBarItems.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}  

this.groupBarItem1.Padding = 10; 

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight VB %}

Me.groupBarItem1.Padding = 10 

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
