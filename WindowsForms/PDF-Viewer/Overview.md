# Windows Forms PDF Viewer (PdfViewerControl) Overview

## Key features

* **Open PDF files**: Open and display PDF files, both normal and protected, with AES and RC4 encryption algorithms (password protected). Open PDF files from stream, file path, and PdfLoadedDocument objects.

* **Customization**: Supports various built-in themes and allows user to create a custom toolbar with all the options that can be performed using the built-in toolbar.
