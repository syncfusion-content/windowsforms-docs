# Zooming and Scrolling in Windows Forms Pivot Chart

The pivot chart control in Windows Forms offers functionality for zooming and scrolling, which enhances the interactivity and usability of visual data presentations. Users can focus on specific data points by zooming into the chart along a single axis or both axes, enabling detailed analysis without distractions from the broader dataset.

This interactivity is achieved by configuring the chart to support zoom operations. Zooming can be selectively enabled for the x-axis, y-axis, or both, depending on the type of data visualization required. This flexibility allows users to examine trends, outliers, and patterns within their data with precision.
