# Windows Forms Pivot Grid Overview

The [WinForms Pivot Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/pivot-grid) control is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control that simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The pivot grid, as the name implies, pivots data to be organized in a cross-tabulated form. The major advantage of pivot grid is that you can extract the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, the pivot grid also enables you to summarize and group the data.

## Key features

The important features of the pivot grid control are listed below:

* **Data binding** - Supports to bind different types of relational data sources such as IList, IEnumerable, etc.
* **Drill support** - Enables to navigate through inner levels of a hierarchy element present in both column and row headers.
* **Pivot Table Field List** - Provides a built-in pivot schema designer very similar to Microsoft’s Excel.
* **Filtering** - Interactive support to filter the data in the pivot grid.
* **Grouping bar** - Interactive support to group the data in the pivot grid.
* **Sorting** - Interactive support to sort the data in the pivot grid.
* **Summaries** - Extensive support to show brief information about the individual data columns or groups of rows.
* **Selection** - Supports to select multiple cells in the pivot grid.
* **Conditional formatting** - Allows to format cells based on certain conditions.
* **Exporting** - Allows to export the pivot grid control into various formats such as PDF, word and excel formats.
* **Printing** - Allows to print the pivot grid control.
* **Tooltip** - Displays row and column values of respective grid cells on mouse hovering.
