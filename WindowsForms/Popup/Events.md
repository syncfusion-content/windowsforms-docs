# Events in Windows Forms Popup (PopupControlContainer)

PopupControlContainer handles events before and after the Popup is shown.

* [`Popup`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_Popup) : It occurs after the Popup has been dropped down and visible. The event handler receives an argument of type EventArgs. This event can be handled to get focus on the PopupControlContainer.

* [`BeforePopup`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_BeforePopup) : It occurs when the Popup is about to be shown. The event handler receives an argument of type CancelEventArgs. The event property associated with the CancelEventArgs is as follows. Cancel - Gets/Sets a value indicating whether the event should be canceled. This event can be handled to resize the PopupControlContainer.

* [`CloseUp`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_CloseUp) : It occurs when a Popup is closed. The event handler receives an argument of type PopupClosedEventArgs. The event property associated with the PopupClosedEventArgs is as follows. PopupCloseType - Returns the PopupCloseType value indicating the way in which the popup can be closed. This event can be handled to transfer data from the Popup to the controls in the Form.

## Popup

This event is handled after the popup is dropped down and made visible. Below is an example for uses Popup event.

### Example Scenario: Mnemonic support

The controls that are placed within the [PopupControlContainer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html) do not respond to mnemonics. The reason for this behavior is that the main form gets focus immediately after the [PopupControlContainer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html) is displayed. However, the work around here would be to set the focus back to the [PopupControlContainer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html) in the PopupControlContainerâ€™s Popup event handler, so that the access keys will work fine.

The below code snippet will explain how to use Popup event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void popupControlContainer1_Popup(object sender, System.EventArgs e) 
{ 
    this.popupControlContainer1.Focus(); 
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private Sub popupControlContainer1_Popup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
	Me.popupControlContainer1.Focus()
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}


## BeforePopup 

This [BeforePopup](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_BeforePopup) event occurs before the popup is shown.

### Example Scenario: Resizing the pop-up

Drag and drop the ParentControl say RichTextBox and PopupControlContainer onto the form. In the [MouseUp](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.mouseup?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.7.2) event of RichTextBox, show the Popup using [ShowPopup](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_ShowPopup_System_Drawing_Point_) method.

To make the Popup resizable, handle [BeforePopup](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_BeforePopup) event of PopupControlContainer and give the following code snippet.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void popupControlContainer1_BeforePopup(object sender, System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e)
{

// Make the pop-up host's border style re-sizable. 
    this.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.SizableToolWindow; 
    this.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.BackColor = this.BackColor;  

// Necessary to set the host's client size every time, especially since the pop-up's Dock style is set to DockStyle.Fill.  
    if(this.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.Size.Width < 160)    
    this.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.Size =new Size(160,176); 

// So that the pop-up container will fill the entire pop-up host when resized.  
    this.popupControlContainer1.Dock= System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill;
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private Sub popupControlContainer1_BeforePopup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs)

' Make the pop-up host's border style re-sizable. 
	Me.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.SizableToolWindow
	Me.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.BackColor = Me.BackColor

' Necessary to set the host's client size every time, especially since the pop-up's Dock style is set to DockStyle.Fill.  
	If Me.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.Size.Width < 160 Then
	Me.popupControlContainer1.PopupHost.Size = New Size(160,176)
	End If

' So that the pop-up container will fill the entire pop-up host when resized.  
	Me.popupControlContainer1.Dock= System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}


## CloseUp 

This [CloseUp](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_CloseUp) event will occur while closing the popup. We can assign data from the Popup to the control in the Form. 

The below code snippet will explain how to use CloseUp event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void popupControlContainer1_CloseUp(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupClosedEventArgs e)
{
	if(e.PopupCloseType == Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Done)
	{
		this.richTextBox1.Text = this.textBox1.Text;
	}

    // Set focus back to textbox.
	if(e.PopupCloseType == Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Done|| e.PopupCloseType == Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Canceled)
	this.richTextBox1.Focus();
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private Sub popupControlContainer1_CloseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupClosedEventArgs)
	If e.PopupCloseType = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Done Then
		Me.richTextBox1.Text = Me.textBox1.Text
	End If

' Set focus back to textbox.
	If e.PopupCloseType = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Done OrElse e.PopupCloseType = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupCloseType.Canceled Then
	Me.richTextBox1.Focus()
	End If
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
