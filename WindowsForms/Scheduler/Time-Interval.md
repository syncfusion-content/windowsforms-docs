# Time Interval in Windows Forms Scheduler (Schedule)

This topic illustrates the time interval format options for scheduling appointments.

## Recurrence rule

The RecurrenceRule is a string value that contains the details of the recurrence appointments with repeated rule types like daily, monthly, yearly, every second, every minute, every hour, how many days it needs to render or count, what is the interval, the time period to render the appointment, etc. RecurrenceRule has the following properties and based on these property values, recurrence appointments are rendered in the Schedule control.

## Setting the time interval in seconds format

The Schedule control, by default, allows you to set the time interval for scheduling appointments only in hours and minutes formats. Now, you can also include seconds in the time interval by enabling the AllowSecondsInAppointment property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.scheduleControl1.AllowSecondsInAppointment = true;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Me.scheduleControl1.AllowSecondsInAppointment = True
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Setting the recurrence appointments in seconds

By default, the Schedule control allows you to add the recurrence appointments only for each day, month, or year. Now, recurrence appointments in the Schedule WF can also be organized in seconds, minutes, and hours. To add the recurrence appointments in seconds, it is necessary to enable the [AllowSecondsInAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/scheduler/time-interval#setting-the-time-interval-in-seconds-format) property. The minimum value used for adding the recurrence appointments is 60 seconds. When the value goes below 60 seconds, then by default, the appointment time assigns 60 seconds. Recurrence Appointments can be added in two ways. 

### Adding recurrence by using Appointment Recurrence dialog

Recurrence appointments can be added by using the Appointment Recurrence dialog box available in the Appointment Form. The Appointment Form can be opened by double clicking any day in the schedule control. Follow the steps:

1. Enter the contents in the subject.
2. Uncheck the All Day event.
3. Enter the Start Time and End Time values.

4. Click the Make Recurring button to open the Appointment Recurrence Dialog.

5. The highlighted area above is the newly implemented recurrence settings.
6. Choose the desired option to make the recurrence appointment in the schedule control and press OK.
7. Now, Save and Close. 

### Adding recurrence by using the RecurrenceRule property

Recurrence appointments can also be added by using the RecurrenceRule property. The RecurrenceRule is a string value that contains the details of the recurrence appointment with repeated rule types like daily, monthly, yearly, every second, every minute, every hour, how many days it needs to render or count, what is the interval, the time period to render the appointment, etc. The rules available in the Recurrence Rule property are listed in the following link.

To use the recurring appointments data provider of the Schedule control, the IRecurringScheduleAppointment interface should be implemented. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
IRecurringScheduleDataProvider dataProvider = scheduleProvider as IRecurringScheduleDataProvider;
IScheduleAppointment app = scheduleProvider.NewScheduleAppointment();
IRecurringScheduleAppointment item = app as IRecurringScheduleAppointment;

if (item != null)
{
    item.StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 05, 06, 1, 0, 0);
    item.EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 05, 06, 2, 0, 0);
    item.Subject = "Call Joe";
    item.RecurrenceRule = "05/06/2015 ;05/07/2015 ;Every DAY;EVERY MIN 10";
    dataProvider.AddNewRecurringAppointments(item, new DateTime(2015, 09, 09));
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Dim dataProvider As IRecurringScheduleDataProvider = TryCast(scheduleProvider, IRecurringScheduleDataProvider)
Dim app As IScheduleAppointment = scheduleProvider.NewScheduleAppointment()
Dim item As IRecurringScheduleAppointment = TryCast(app, IRecurringScheduleAppointment)

If item IsNot Nothing Then
item.StartTime = New DateTime(2015, 05, 06, 1, 0, 0)
item.EndTime = New DateTime(2015, 5, 6, 2, 0, 0)
item.Subject = "Call Joe"
item.RecurrenceRule = "05/06/2015 ;05/07/2015 ;Every DAY;EVERY MIN 10"
dataProvider.AddNewRecurringAppointments(item, New DateTime(2015, 09, 09))
End If
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The following screenshot displays appointments shown in the day view every 10 minutes from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM.
