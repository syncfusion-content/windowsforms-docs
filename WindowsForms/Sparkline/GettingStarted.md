# Getting Started with Windows Forms Sparkline

This section provides the details that you will need to know about getting started with our Sparkline control. 

## Assembly deployment

Refer [control dependencies](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/control-dependencies#sparkline) section to get the list of assemblies or NuGet package needs to be added as reference to use the control in any application.

Please find more details regarding how to install the nuget packages in windows form application in the below link:

## Adding sparkline to form

To add sparkline to your form, follow the given steps:

1.Open your form in the designer. Add the Syncfusion controls to your VS.NET toolbox if you have not done it already (the install would have automatically done this unless you selected not to complete toolbox integration during installation).

2.Drag the sparkline control from toolbox and drop into the form. The default appearance of sparkline will be rendered.
