# Windows Forms Splash Panel Overview

The SplashPanel is a System.Windows.Forms panel-derived class that allows users to design custom splash screens within the form's designer. The SplashPanel can take multiple child controls that can be used to display information or collect information from the user.

The SplashPanel class is a panel class that can be used beyond the typical splash screen. It can be used to create non-obtrusive message boxes such as in the Microsoft MSN messenger (as of MSN Messenger version 3.0), a message window that informs a user that a new mail message has arrived. These kinds of message boxes are very easy to create and use with the SplashPanel class.
