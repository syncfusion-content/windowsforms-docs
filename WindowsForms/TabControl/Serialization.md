# Serialization in Windows Forms TabControl (TabControlAdv)

The [PersistTabState](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabControlAdv.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_TabControlAdv_PersistTabState) property specifies the value which determines whether the TabState (ActivePage, TabOrder and Text) should be automatically persisted or not. The default value is set to `false`.
