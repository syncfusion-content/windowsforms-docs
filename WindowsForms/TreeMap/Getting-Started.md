# Getting Started with Windows Forms TreeMap

Tree maps are a growing trend in data visualization. They display hierarchical information in a series of clustered rectangles, which represent a whole rectangle. The size of each box represents a quantity. Tree maps can also use color to represent any number of values, but colors are often used to categorize the various boxes within the tree map.

## Assembly deployment

Refer [control dependencies](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/control-dependencies#treemap) section to get the list of assemblies or NuGet package needs to be added as reference to use the control in any application.

Please find more details regarding how to install the nuget packages in windows form application in the below link:
