# Windows Forms AutoLabel Overview

The **AutoLabel** control is a Label-inspired control that lets you pair a label with any other control. Once paired, the AutoLabel is automatically repositioned as the labeled control's position changes.

The FlowLayout layout manager always treats the AutoLabel-labeled control pair as a unit. You can use AutoLabels and FlowLayouts together to implement complex and powerful form layouts.
