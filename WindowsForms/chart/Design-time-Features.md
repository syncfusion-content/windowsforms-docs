2. Right-click anywhere in the chart to see a context menu.
3. Select the chart wizard item from the context menu.

### At Run Time

Optionally, you can also let your users to invoke this Wizard during run-time to let them customize the Chart's look and feel. To invoke the Chart wizard at runtime, use the below code.

{% endseealso %}

## Chart Templates

EssentialChart provides support to save the series and point properties as XML file. This enables you to save the series and point properties into chart template and load the chart templates into the [Chart Control](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html) when needed. 

### Use Case Scenarios

When you want to create charts with consistent look and feel, you can utilize this feature. You can load the saved chart source to achieve this. 

### Working with Chart Template

Essential Chart is now associated with the creation and loading of chart templates into the [ChartControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html). It provides easy methods to save and load the templates. This section will walk you through the saving, loading and resetting of the chart templates and the various benefits of using it.

### Benefits

* Aesthetic items like appearance, positioning etc., of a chart can be saved in the template.
* Appearance settings saved in a Chart Template is reusable.
* Stores any static data, if available in the chart.
* The user can save the existing structure of the chart control to an .xml file format.
* All the charts in your applications can be created with consistent look and feel.

### Save Template

The appearance settings for various components of a Chart like [ChartSeries](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartSeries.html), [ChartArea](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartArea.html), Series properties and Point properties can be stored in a template, which can be loaded into new [Chart Control](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html) when needed.

A chart template can contain the properties of more than one data series. When such templates are loaded into a destination [ChartControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html), the appearance settings of the data series will be applied in a sequential order, i.e., the first set of appearance settings of a data series will be applied to the destination Chart's first series and the second set of appearance properties of the data series will be applied to the destination Chart's second series and so on. 

If the destination collection's length is larger than the source collection, then the settings will repeat itself for these additional entries in the destination collection.

These Charts can be saved as templates in the below two ways.

* Selecting the **Save Template** option from the context menu as shown above.
* By clicking the **Save Template** designer verb in the Visual Studio property browser as shown above.

[ChartTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartTemplate.html) has a static method to save the data programmatically. We need to pass [ChartControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html) instance and a file name(it can accept stream file also.), through this save method.

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# %}

ChartTemplate.Save(this.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml");

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

ChartTemplate.Save(Me.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml")

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Load Template

EssentialChart provides support to load the saved [Chart Template](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartTemplate.html) into a new chart control. This loads the series properties and the point properties, which was saved in a XML file and applies these properties into the new chart control.

* Selecting the **Load Template** from the context menu at the design time.
* By clicking the **Load Template** designer verb in the Visual Studio property browser. 

[ChartTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartTemplate.html) has static method to load the template data programmatically. We need to pass the ChartControl which will be applied with the loaded template data.

### Saving chart series data

You can save the data points of chart series in a template. The 'StoreAllProperties' and 'StoreSeriesData' static properties of 'ChartTemplate' can be used to specify whether data points of chart series should be stored in template.

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# %}

ChartTemplate.StoreSeriesData = true;
ChartTemplate.Save(this.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml");

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

ChartTemplate.StoreSeriesData = true
ChartTemplate.Save(Me.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml")

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Saving styles of data points

You can also save the styles of data points such as 'Symbol' and 'Text' in template. The 'StoreAllProperties' and 'StoreSeriesStyle' static properties of 'ChartTemplate' can be used to specify whether the styles of the data points should be stored in template.

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# %}

ChartTemplate.StoreSeriesStyle = true;
ChartTemplate.Save(this.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml");

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

ChartTemplate.StoreSeriesStyle = true
ChartTemplate.Save(Me.chartControl1, "TemplateName.xml")

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Reset Template

The [ChartControl](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartControl.html), which when loaded with a template will be applied with the appearance and other settings that were stored in the template. These settings can be reset and the Chart can be reverted back to its original appearance by using the below two methods.

* Selecting the **Reset Template** from the context menu at the design time.
* By clicking the **Reset Template** link in the Visual Studio property browser.

[ChartTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartTemplate.html) can be reset using the following simple statements,

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# %}

ChartTemplate ct = new ChartTemplate();

ct.Reset(this.chartControl1);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

ChartTemplate ct = New ChartTemplate()

ct.Reset(Me.chartControl1)

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
