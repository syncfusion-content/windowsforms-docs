# How to implement DrillDown charts

DrillDown charts can essentially be implemented by listening to the click events in the chart and either replacing the current visible chart with another chart that has drill-down information or reinitializing the chart with new drill-down information.

The ChartRegionClick event will let you listen to the user clicking on the data points in a chart.

The sample at "My Documents\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\Version Number\Windows\Chart.Windows\Samples\2.0\User Interaction\Chart Drill Down" illustrates the second approach.
