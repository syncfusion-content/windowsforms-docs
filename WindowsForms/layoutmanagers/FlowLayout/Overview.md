# Windows Forms LayoutManagers Overview

The `FlowLayout` is a layout manager. It allows users arrange the child components horizontally or vertically in a specific order based on the settings. FlowLayout is one of the most commonly used layout managers. By deriving from the LayoutManager class, the FlowLayout component is created to support simple horizontal and vertical flows and complex constraint-based FlowLayouts.

In its simplest form, this Layout Manager can be used to automatically arrange the child components in one or more rows.
