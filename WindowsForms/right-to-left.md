# Right to Left support in Syncfusion Windows Forms Controls

Right to Left (RTL) support displays the content from right-to-left direction by setting the [RightToLeft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.righttoleft?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.8#System_Windows_Forms_Control_RightToLeft) property to `Yes`. This is helpful to support the Right-to-Left scripted languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, etc.,

All Windows Forms Syncfusion controls supports Right-to-Left (RTL) based on FlowDirection property. In addition to that, all controls provides [localization](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/localization) support to change language of strings used in control specific to any culture.
