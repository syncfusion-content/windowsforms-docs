# TreeViewAdv Events in WinForms TreeView(SfTreeView)

This section covers the events related to the below concepts.

## Node Painting Events

This section discusses the below node painting events.

### AfterNodePaint Event

This event is discussed [here](/windowsforms/treeview/treeview-appearance#drawing-selected-node-foreground).

### BeforeNodePaint

This event is discussed in [Drawing Selected Node Foreground](/windowsforms/treeview/treeview-appearance#drawing-selected-node-foreground).

## CheckBox Event

This section discusses AfterInteractiveChecks Event.

### AfterInteractiveChecks Event

InteractiveCheckBox settings available for the TreeNodeAdv indicates whether the node will have an interactive checkbox. This AfterInteractiveChecks event will be triggered when the checked state of one or more nodes of a TreeViewAdv has changed due to this InteractiveCheckbox setting.

#### Event Data

The TreeNodeAdvEventHandler receives an argument of type TreeNodeAdvEventArgs containing data related to this event. The following TreeNodeAdvEventArgs members provide information specific to this event.

Check or uncheck TreeNodeAdv using the Mouse

This can be done by handling the TreeViewAdv's BeforeCheck event as shown below.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeCheck(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeCheckEventArgs e)
{
   if (Control.MouseButtons == MouseButtons.Left)

e.Cancel = True
End If
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Leave Event

This event is triggered when the control is no longer the active control of the form. An example which uses the Leave event is as follows.

How to Use Delete Key for Deleting and as a Shortcut to BarItems / MenuItems of TreeViewAdv

The form contains a treeViewAdv with nodes with LabelEdit property set to true as well as BarItems or MenuItems with Delete key as their shortcut. 

After editing the node by pressing F2, if the Delete key is pressed, to avoid the menu shortcut from getting triggered and trigger the deletion of text in the editor, follow the procedure below.

Disable the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gets focus and enable the shortcut as soon as the editor loses focus. It can be done by handling the TreeViewAdv's BeforeEdit event, setting the bar item's shortcut to None and listening to the node's edit textbox's Leave event. Within this Leave event handler, set the bar item's shortcut back to Del.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

TextBox editor;
private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs e)
{
    this.editor = e.TextBox;
    this.editor.Leave += new EventHandler(editor_Leave);

// Disabling  the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gets focused.
    this.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.None;
}

// Enabling the shortcut as soon as the editor loses focus.
private void editor_Leave(object sender, EventArgs args)
{
    this.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.Del;
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private editor As TextBox
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs)
Me.editor = e.TextBox
AddHandler editor.Leave, AddressOf editor_Leave

'Disabling the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gets focused.
Me.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.None
End Sub
Private Sub editor_Leave(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As EventArgs)

' Enabling the shortcut as soon as the editor loses focus.
Me.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.Del
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Methods to make a node completely un editable even when the,

1. Node is visible.
2. Node is click able.

BeforeEdit event can be used for this purpose. In this example, the Parent Nodes are made un editable.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs.Node indicates the target node for editing.

The desired condition is checked on that node and based on the result, the TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs.Cancel property is set appropriately.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs e)
{

// Check if they are parent nodes.
    if ((e.Node.Text == "Node0") || (e.Node.Text == "Node5")) 
    {
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs)

' Check if they are parent nodes.
If (e.Node.Text = "Node0") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node5") Then
e.Cancel = True
End If
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Cancel Read / Write property for particular user nodes

By canceling the BeforeEdit event for particular nodes of particular users, the Read/Write property can be canceled. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs e)
{

// By cancel the BeforeEdit event for particular nodes helps to cancel the Read/Write property of that nodes. 
    if(username=="user1")
    {
        if ((e.Node.Text == "Node0") || (e.Node.Text == "Node5")||(e.Node.Text == "Node3")||(e.Node.Text == "Node8")) 
        {
            e.Cancel = true;
        }
    }
    else if(username=="user2")
    if ((e.Node.Text == "Node2") || (e.Node.Text == "Node4")||(e.Node.Text == "Node6")||(e.Node.Text == "Node10")) 
    {
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs)

' By cancel the BeforeEdit event for particular nodes helps to cancel the Read/Write property of that nodes. 
If username="user1" Then
If (e.Node.Text = "Node0") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node5") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node3") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node8") Then
e.Cancel = True
End If
Else If username="user2" Then
If (e.Node.Text = "Node2") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node4") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node6") OrElse (e.Node.Text = "Node10") Then
e.Cancel = True
End If
End If
End Sub

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The following figure shows the color change for some of the nodes of the user that indicates the canceled Read/Write property for that node.

## Node Selection

### BeforeSelect Event

This event occurs before a node is selected. This event is illustrated in [How to prevent a node from being selected](/windowsforms/treeview/faq/how-to-prevent-a-node-from-being-selected) topic.

### HotTracking Events in TreeViewAdv

#### Description

In TreeViewAdv, a NodeHotTrackChanged event enables users to retrieve the TreeViewAdv node which is currently being hot tracked by the mouse. This event will be triggered when the mouse moves over the nodes in a tree view, and the node that is currently selected by the mouse pointer is the hot tracked node.

#### Use Cases

If a user needs to get a particular nodeâs details as it is being tracked by the mouse pointer, this event will provide this information through its event arguments.

Hide Context Menu When user clicks on an Empty Space on the TreeViewAdv

If the user clicks on an empty space on the TreeViewAdv, the appearance of the context menu can be avoided by handling MouseDown and MouseUp event handlers. With the help of this, the user will be able to know which node is being edited currently. Here the Selected node is set to RMouseDownNode. The RMouseDownNode gets / sets the node on which, the user had done a Right-MouseDown.
