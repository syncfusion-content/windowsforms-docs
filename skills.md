# Syncfusion Windows Forms Agent Skills for AI Assistants

This guide introduces **Syncfusion Windows Forms Skills**, a knowledge package that enables AI assistants (VS Code, Cursor, CodeStudio, etc.) to understand and generate accurate Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">®</sup> Windows Forms code using official APIs, patterns, and theming guidelines.

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Skills eliminate common issues with generic AI suggestions by grounding the assistant in accurate Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> component usage patterns, API structures, supported features, and project‑specific configuration.

## Installation

Choose one of the following commands to install [Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Windows Forms components skills](https://github.com/syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-components-skills.git) based on your preference. Users can also explore Syncfusion skills from the [marketplace](https://skills.sh/syncfusion/).

```bash
# Install all component skills at once
npx skills add syncfusion/winforms-ui-components-skills -y

# Choose and install skills interactively from the terminal
npx skills add syncfusion/winforms-ui-components-skills
```

This registers the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> skill pack so your AI assistant can automatically load it in supported IDEs such as [Code Studio](https://help.syncfusion.com/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/skills), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills), and [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/skills).

To learn more about the Skills CLI, refer [here](https://skills.sh/docs). 

## What’s included

1. **Component Usage & API Knowledge** — Curated, Skill‑based guidance that captures how to add, configure, and compose Syncfusion® Windows Forms components, including key props, events, services/modules to inject (where applicable), and common integration patterns.
2. **Patterns & Best Practices** — Practical recommendations for API structures, state‑handling approaches, and feature‑injection workflows (for example, paging, sorting, and filtering for data components). All guidance is authored directly within the Skill file rather than being fetched from documentation.
3. **Design‑System Guidance** — Includes information related to themes, dark/light variants, and icon usage patterns across Syncfusion® Windows Forms components.

## How Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Agent Skills Work

1. **Reads the relevant Skill files based on the user’s query**, with the assistant retrieving component usage patterns, APIs, and best‑practice guidance from the installed Syncfusion® Skills.
2. **Enforces Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> best practices**, including:

   - Using the required feature modules for each component.
   - Injecting applicable component modules (for example, paging, sorting, filtering, and other feature modules).
   - Adding the correct theme and style imports.
3. **Generates component‑accurate code**, avoiding invalid props or unsupported patterns

### Using the AI Assistant

Once skills are installed, the assistant can be used to generate and update Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Windows Forms code for tasks such as:

- “Add a Grid with paging, sorting, and filtering.”
- “Create a Scheduler with week view and drag‑drop.”
